%problem 1 
\item A neutral atom with atomic number 6 will have 6 electrons and 6 protons. 
  
%problem 2  
\item The maximum number of electrons that can exist in an given atom shell $ n $ is calculated by the formula

\[
  N = 2n^2
\]

This means that the maximum number of electronics in the third shell of an atom is
\[ 
  2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18
\]

%problem 3
\item
Materials are categorized into three groups called isolators, semiconductors, and conductors. Isolators have the largest band gap between the conduction band and valence band. Semiconductors will have a smaller band gap than isolators. Conductors have an overlap between the conduction band and the valence band.
